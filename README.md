Point of Interest Web App

This is an implementation of the POI Web App at the "outstanding" grading-band level. Though it probably doesn't meet all the rquirements fully.

Users can sign up, sign in, and are able to add, update, and view points of interest(POIs) - which are made up of a name, description, location(lat, lon), categories, and an array of images. Name, description, location, and categories can be updated. Multiple images can be added.

There is a user dashboard where they can view their POIs and a general POI board where they can view points of interest from all users. The users can also add their own custom categories for points of interest. There is also a user settings page where they can update their details.

There is an admin dashboard where the administrator can view all users, delete users, add points of interest. Admins can also update any POI.

The database is in the cloud on MongoDB atlas.
